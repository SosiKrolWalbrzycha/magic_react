        <h1>Unicus - Cement flower Vase</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				The Unicus line of products draws its inspiration from the Rubik's Cube, a 3D logic puzzle invented in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, which involves arranging colorful squares. While playing with the cube, it struck me that its simple structure of protruding cubes could look astonishing, serving as a delightful piece of home decor, especially in spaces with an industrial vibe. The Unicus can be utilized as a vase for flowers or as a planter for succulents.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
				Unicus is a considerably weighty decorative vessel made of cement. The casting process is straightforward, although the demolding (removal from the mold) demands considerable strength and concentration. The sharp edges and high tension of the mold might result in hand injuries or damage to the mold. However, the most significant challenge was designing the model and mold itself. This model consists of 180 squares along with their adjoining walls. Although I haven't counted them all, I must admit it took about two months to prepare the model. The end product, Unicus, is quite captivating and is bound to be the center of attention.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
				The Unicus cement vase can be used both indoors and outdoors. However, the Regulus concrete pot does not come with a drainage hole, so it's crucial always to use a kermazite substrate. When placing the Regulus outdoors, ensure that rainfall doesn't inundate the plant roots, as this could be detrimental. The Regulus concrete pot stands as an exclusive gift that will undoubtedly bring joy to its owner for many years.

				<p>Height: 27.5 cm (10.8 inches)</p> 
				<p>Inner diagonal: 12 cm (4.7 inches) </p>
