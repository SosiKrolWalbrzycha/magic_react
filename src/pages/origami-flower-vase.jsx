        <h1>Concrete flower vase - Origami</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
					The Origami product line is the result of our fascination with Chinese culture and, at the same time, a
					tribute to the art of the middle country. Shapes inspired by the Chinese art of paper folding work well both
					in spacious rooms and in tight spaces where there is no space. Origami inspiration offers unlimited potential.
					It allows you to design complex and extremely inventive everyday objects.
				</p>
				<h4>Production:</h4>
				<p>
					Origami vases are very difficult to manufacture. In the first step, we spent a lot of time preparing the
					model. Due to the many edges, the real surface to be processed is numerous. Due to the size and number of
					edges, tools cannot be used for grinding. Removing the product from the mold is not easy because it requires
					strength. Unfortunately, the form is not very resistant to damage. Only 4 ready-made vases are made from one
					mold.
				</p>
				<h4>How o use:</h4>
				<p>
				The Origami flower vase can be used indoors and outdoors. The shape is also great in small rooms. We recommend a concrete origami vase as a fashionable and attractive gift for her.
				</p>
				<h4>Sizes:</h4>
				<p>Width: 12 cm or 7.72 In</p>
				<p>Height: 25 cm or 9.84 In</p> <p>Weight: about 3 kgÂ </p>
