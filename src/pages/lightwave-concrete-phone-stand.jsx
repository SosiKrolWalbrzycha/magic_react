        <h1>LightWave - Concrete smartphone stand</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				When envisioning the design for our phone stand, we were driven by an urge to challenge the typical attributes associated with concrete. How could we craft a piece that redefined the boundaries of thickness and weight while preserving the essence of concrete? After numerous prototypes, each with walls measuring around 4-5 millimeters in thickness, our vision materialized into what we now proudly call "LightWave." This exquisitely delicate phone stand, astonishingly weighing under 1 kg, represents an avant-garde approach to concrete design, making it stand out in its category.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
                LightWave's distinctiveness doesn't merely stem from its weight or dimensions. Unlike most concrete objects cast from the bottom, this piece is uniquely side-cast. Its slender wall, merely 8 millimeters in width, lends it a fragile charm, rarely associated with concrete. Extracting it from its mold is a meticulous task, given the mold's inherent instability due to the design. Each LightWave is a testament to our dedication to pushing the envelope in concrete craftsmanship.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
                With its unconventional form, the LightWave phone stand effortlessly draws attention, setting it apart from the stereotypical concrete items. Whether gracing an office desk or accentuating a stylish home setup, this concrete marvel is more than just a functional accessory; it's a statement piece. Ideal for design aficionados, the LightWave stand elevates any space it inhabits. Gift it to someone with an eye for innovative home decor or treat yourself to this masterpiece, and let it serve as a daily reminder of design's limitless possibilities.
