        <h1>HeavyLoop - Concrete phone holder</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				HeavyLoop wasn't birthed from a whimsical idea or a fleeting muse but from a palpable necessity. As the world rapidly transitioned online amidst the pandemic, the frequency of virtual meetings skyrocketed. Surprisingly, amidst the plethora of tech gadgets available, an elegant smartphone holder suitable for a professional desk setting was noticeably absent. This gap sparked the concept for HeavyLoop. A phone holder that seemingly defies gravity, yet is anchored firmly in place, striking a balance between aesthetic allure and unyielding stability.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
                Over time and through various projects, I mastered the art of casting objects from the bottom, ensuring the pouring point remains hidden from the eye, maintaining a flawless facade. However, with HeavyLoop, we ventured into unfamiliar territory by casting the object from the side. This technique resulted in one of the side walls being slightly uneven. Yet, after meticulous polishing and refining, it exudes a rugged charm. The defining feature of HeavyLoop, however, remains its razor-sharp edges, exemplifying precision and attention to detail.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
				The HeavyLoop smartphone holder, with its audacious and hefty design, appeals especially to those who harbor an appreciation for the unconventional, the asymmetric, and the gravity-defying. Despite its resilient stance, it's important to handle it with care. Its significant weight means a fall could have consequences, so always ensure it's securely placed, away from the table's edge. Especially keep it out of reach of young children. As both a functional piece and a statement in home decor, the HeavyLoop concrete holder is a perfect addition to any office setting or chic workspace. Gift it to someone with a discerning eye for design, and watch it transform their desk into a display of elegance and innovation.
