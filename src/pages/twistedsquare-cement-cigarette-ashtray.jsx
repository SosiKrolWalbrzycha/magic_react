        <h1>TwistedSquare - Cement cigarette ashtray</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				The "Twisted Square" series, meticulously designed with the wonders of our planet in mind, is a tribute to Earth's counter-clockwise rotation - a motion opposite to the traditional clockwise turn of a clock. Its helical design ensures that this unique piece presents a captivating view from every angle. And not to mention, the pronounced edges not only augment its architectural design but also catch the light in the most enchanting way, creating unparalleled reflections that elevate any space it occupies.
				</p>
				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
				Precision and acute attention to detail were vital in achieving the razor-sharp edges of the Twisted Square cement ashtray. However, this feat of engineering wasn't the only hurdle we encountered. The unpredictability of concrete as a medium presented its own set of challenges. Despite utilizing the same mix, two separate casts can often result in varying shades, even if they are dried under identical conditions and timeframes. This anomaly, though intriguing, is a testament to concrete's capricious nature. A quick glance at the provided photos will showcase this phenomenon.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
				Perfectly suited for both cigarette and cigar aficionados, the concrete ashtray stands out as a thoughtful gift, seamlessly merging functionality with exquisite home decor. To maintain its pristine appearance and prevent discoloration, regular cleaning is recommended. If you choose to place this masterpiece outdoors, exercise caution during colder months. Ensure it remains free of water, as frozen liquid can cause it to crack, diminishing its aesthetic and functional value.
