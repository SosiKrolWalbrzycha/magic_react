        <h1>Castor - Concrete tealight stand</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				The Castor collection draws deep inspiration from the timeless allure of the regular pentagon. This shape, with its five equidistant sides, holds historical and symbolic significance that has resonated with cultures and civilizations throughout millennia. Its diagonals converge harmoniously to craft the evocative pentagram, a symbol that has been revered, interpreted, and celebrated in countless ways. In our humble capacity as concrete artisans, we've chosen not to delve into the vast interpretative ocean of pentagonal symbolism. Instead, we've anchored our creation in the raw beauty of the shape, inviting you to embark on your own journey of meaning, while we bask in its sheer geometric elegance.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
                While molding petite concrete structures may seem like a straightforward task, the nuances in the Castor design present their unique challenges. The meticulous process requires utmost care, especially during the demolding phase. This is due to the susceptibility of the molds to "chafing" or wear when extracting the finished piece. Such intricacies, although seemingly minor, necessitate a gentle touch and understanding of the material, ensuring each tealight stand retains its pristine form while acknowledging the fragile nature of its mold.
