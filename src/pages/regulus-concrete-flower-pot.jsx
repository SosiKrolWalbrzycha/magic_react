        <h1>Regulus - Concrete flower pot</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
				At the heart of our Regulus collection lies the intrinsic allure of the square, a shape that celebrates equilibrium and symmetry. Derived from the unadulterated essence of this four-sided figure, the Regulus concrete pot elevates its design by incorporating a staggering 180 miniature diamond facets. This intricate detail, coupled with the pot's multi-faceted edges, transforms it into more than just a functional item - it becomes a statement piece, a conversation starter. Since its inception, Regulus has transcended borders, finding its way into homes across Europe and North America, serving as a testament to its universal appeal and our commitment to artistry.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>
				<p>
                Every Regulus flower pot, with its substantial weight of approximately 7 kilograms, stands as a monumental tribute to our dedication and physical exertion in the crafting process. However, the weight isn't the most challenging aspect of its creation. Before this concrete masterpiece could be cast, the precursor mold itself underwent meticulous refinement. The act of perfecting the surface of these 180 diamonds was a labor of love that spanned nearly three months. Our fingers bore the brunt of this painstaking process, facing fatigue and discomfort. Yet, every ache, every exertion was worth the final product - an embodiment of dedication and precision.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
                Designed with versatility in mind, the Regulus flower pot can seamlessly grace both indoor and outdoor spaces. If you opt for indoor placements, ensure the use of a kermazite substrate, as the pot doesn't feature drainage capabilities. For those who envision its presence outdoors, it's crucial to shield your plant's roots from excess rainwater, ensuring their well-being. With its avant-garde design, Regulus is not just a succulent pot but a testament to artistic endeavor. Whether for your personal space or as a cherished gift, it promises to stand the test of time, offering beauty and functionality in equal measure.
