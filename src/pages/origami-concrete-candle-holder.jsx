				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>

                Delving deep into the intricate art forms of the East, our Origami concrete candle holder is a manifestation of our profound admiration for Chinese culture. This product line pays homage to the ancient Chinese art of paper folding, which resonates with creativity and limitless imagination. Each facet of the candle holder, while evoking a sense of expansive grandeur, is carefully crafted to adapt to both open and more intimate spaces. The very essence of Origami, with its countless possibilities and transformative nature, opens up a horizon of design possibilities, letting us craft pieces that are as sophisticated as they are enthralling.

                The elegance of the Origami concrete candle holder, despite its seemingly compact design, is a testament to the meticulousness that goes into its crafting. At a glance, one might believe that these candle holders are fairly straightforward to produce, given their size. Yet, therein lies the true challenge. Each holder, due to its multifaceted design, undergoes a unique hydration process, ensuring that no two pieces are ever truly identical in color. This unpredictability, far from being a flaw, adds to the allure of each piece, making every single one a unique artwork in its own right.
