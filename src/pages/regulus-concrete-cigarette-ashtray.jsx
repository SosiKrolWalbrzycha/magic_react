				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
                The Regulus collection is anchored in the timeless allure of the square, a symbol of harmony and balance. Diving deeper into this essence, we introduce the Regulus cigarette ashtray - a sophisticated melding of form and function. Drawing from the core design elements that made the Regulus pot an sensation, the ashtray integrates the series' signature 68 diamond facets, delivering a piece that doesn't merely serve its purpose but captivates the observer. The ashtray, with its multidimensional facets, becomes not just an accessory but an artwork, a topic of discourse, reinforcing our belief that even everyday objects can be imbued with artistic vision.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>

                The creation of the Regulus - concrete cigarette ashtray is a feat of artistry and labor. Weighing considerably less than the flower pot, its real challenge lies in the delicate molding process. The intricate design of the 68 diamonds requires keen attention to detail and a finesse that has been refined over months of relentless practice. This painstaking process, spanning approximately three months, saw our hands tirelessly etching, carving, and refining to achieve that desired perfection. Every minute spent, every gentle caress of the mold was in pursuit of crafting an ashtray that wasn't just functional but also an epitome of design excellence.
