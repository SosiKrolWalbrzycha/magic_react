        <h1>Cannon Ball XL - concrete candle holder</h1>
				<h4>Inspiration:</h4>
				<p>
                The tapestry of history weaves stories into the very fabric of our surroundings, often leaving behind artifacts that stand as silent witnesses to the tales of bygone eras. Such is the genesis of the CannonBall concrete planter pot, a harmonious blend of antiquity and contemporary design. Deeply rooted in the rich lore of Lower Silesia, this unique piece draws its inspiration from centuries-old cannonballs - relics of monumental conflicts like the Hundred Years' War and the Hussite Wars. Stumbling upon such a historically charged artifact near my residence ignited the spark to conceive a design that would merge this ancient relic with the minimalistic sensibilities of the modern world.

				<h4>Craftmanship:</h4>

                Each CannonBall concrete planter pot stands as a testament to the artistry and challenges faced during its creation. Perfectly casting a sphere, especially one that embodies the heft and aura of a cannonball, is no trivial task. The precision required in aligning the molds is paramount, as even the slightest misalignment can mar its flawless curvature. Despite numerous attempts, achieving an utterly immaculate cast remained elusive. However, these very imperfections, unintentional though they might be, add character to each pot. The resulting smooth surface, juxtaposed with its unexpected structural nuances, captures and reflects light in a mesmerizing dance.

				<h4>Usage Guidelines:</h4>
				<p>
                Marrying form with function, the CannonBall concrete planter pot is adept for both indoor and outdoor settings. Its solid concrete design, however, lacks drainage capabilities, making the use of a kermazite substrate imperative. This ensures optimal moisture levels for your plants, especially crucial if placed outdoors, where excess rainfall can potentially saturate and harm the plant's roots. Beyond its primary function, the CannonBall serves as an exquisite addition to any living space or a stylish adornment for a contemporary desk setup. It is more than just a planter; it is a piece of art, a conversation starter, and a unique gift for those who possess an eye for design and a heart for history.
